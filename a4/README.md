# FriendNet
FriendNet is a simple Facebook clone run on the command line that allows users to see each other, make friends, post to and view each others' profiles. It was my final CSC209 assignment, and I earned a final score of 100%.

In the project, I was responsible for completing the ```friend_server.c``` and ```friends.c``` files.
